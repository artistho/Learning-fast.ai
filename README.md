# Learning-fast.ai-Part-1-Lesson-1-v2
This notebook contains my notes for fast.ai Part 1 v2 Lesson 1. In it you will find my lesson's learned, comments on what each line of code does, and especially, detail explanation of the following plotting functions written by Jeremy: rand_by_mask(), rand_by_correct(), plots(), plot_val_with_title(), most_by_mask(), and most_by_correct(). In the end, you will find an Appendix with some of the most used Numpy functions used in these functions and their links to their references.
